Manage cooperators of a cooperative.

A basic flow can be the following:

- Create subscription request for a person (moral or physical)
- Validate subscription request, a capital release request (`account.invoice`).
  This invoice is sent to the future cooperator.
- Payment of the cooperator is registered and the capital Release
  request is marked as paid.
- A new cooperator (a special partner) is created, and the right type
  and amount of share is linked to this new cooperator.
- The new cooperator appears in the Cooperator Registry.

Features:

- Manage several share types
- Manage share subscription request
- Cooperators can be individuals or companies
- Get an up to date Cooperator Registry
- See shares of a cooperator on the partner view
- Manage departure of cooperators
- Manage conversion between different share type
- Send automatic mail to the future cooperator during the procedure
- Can be used with multi-company configuration
- Generate Cooperator Certificate and several reports about cooperators

Configurations:

- on the company, set a default payment term for the capital release requests.
- on the company, set the cooperator account.

Installation
============

## Migrating from easy_my_coop* to cooperator modules

Run this command before updating your modules

.. code-block:: shell

  cat rename_deprecated_modules.py | ./odoo/odoo-bin shell -c odoo.conf --no-http  --stop-after-init -d <db-name>

## Deploying with pip

We used [odoo setup tools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools-odoo/#packaging-a-single-addon) to generate the pypi files from the odoo manifests. To deploy any packaged module, so that odoo can later install them,
you can create a venv with this name (it's git-ignored)
```shell
python -m venv venv
```
And then pip-install them [from pypi](https://pypi.org/user/coopdevs/).

### Example

For instance, for the addon `cooperator_portal`

.. code-block:: shell

  pip install odoo12-addon-cooperator-portal==12.0.1.0.0.99.dev9

Beware that for word separation, pypi uses dashes `-` and odoo underscores `_`.

Usage
=====

See the [documentation](https://doc.it4socialeconomy.org/books/application-cooperators) (not available in english ATM).

A localization module is needed with this module.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Gather and consolidate all cooperator settings in the application parameters.

Consider a refactoring for:
1. removing a potential redundancy between the boolean field "representative" and the address type "representative".
2. prevent new contacts to have the representative address type, if they are not representative.
See [this issue](https://github.com/coopiteasy/vertical-cooperative/issues/350)

known_caveats: the cooperator localization modules will have to be splitted in order to install the `cooperator` module without the `cooperator_website` module.

Changelog
=========

12.0.6.0.0 (2022-09-27)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

backport changes from migration to 14.0.

**Features**

- remove subscription request ``subscription`` state (use ``new`` instead)
  (was used when creating a subscription request from a partner).
- refactor subscription request ``.create()`` method to handle both people
  and companies.
- add several subscription request tests.
- make country and language fields mandatory on the web form.
- some code refactoring and cleanup.
- improve ``fr`` and ``fr_be`` translations.


**Bugfixes**

- improve email and report templates: correct some strings, clean up
  some whitespace, and fix references to first name for companies
  (instead of displaying "false").
- fix partner matching by email or company register number when creating
  a subscription request.
- fix subscription request name for companies: use company name (like
  previously) instead of representative name. the name is displayed in
  the title of the form, and can be used to search.
- fix name of reports and attachments.


12.0.5.3.0 (2022-09-05)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Improved Documentation**

- Adding USAGE.rst to inform that localization modules are necessary. (`#346 <https://github.com/coopiteasy/vertical-cooperative/issues/346>`_)


12.0.5.0.0 (2022-06-23)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Deprecations and Removals**

- When no cooperator account is defined on the company, this module previously
  defaulted to the account with code '416000'. This behaviour has been removed
  because the code is Belgian-only. The functionality has been moved to
  ``l10n_be_cooperator``. (`#314 <https://github.com/coopiteasy/vertical-cooperative/issues/314>`_)


12.0.3.3.2 (2022-06-20)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bugfixes**

- Fix name computation crash (`#330 <https://github.com/coopiteasy/vertical-cooperative/issues/330>`_)
