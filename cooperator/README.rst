Manage cooperators of a cooperative.

A basic flow can be the following:

- Create subscription request for a person (moral or physical)
- Validate subscription sequest, a capital release request (`account.invoice`). This invoice is sent to the future cooperator.
- Payment of the cooperator is registered and the capital Release
  request is marked as paid.
- A new cooperator (a special partner) is created, and the right type
  and amount of share is linked to this new cooperator.
- The new cooperator appears in the Cooperator Registry.

Features:

- Manage several share types
- Manage share subscription request
- Cooperators can be individuals or companies
- Get an up to date Cooperator Registry
- See shares of a cooperator on the partner view
- Manage departure of cooperators
- Manage conversion between different share type
- Send automatic mail to the future cooperator during the procedure
- Can be used with multi-company configuration
- Generate Cooperator Certificate and several reports about cooperators

Installation
============

## Deploying with pip

We used [odoo setup tools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools-odoo/#packaging-a-single-addon) to generate the pypi files from the odoo manifests. To deploy any packaged module, so that odoo can later install them,
you can create a venv with this name (it's git-ignored)
```shell
python -m venv venv
```
And then pip-install them [from pypi](https://pypi.org/user/coopdevs/).

### Example

For instance, for the addon `easy_my_coop_website_portal`
```shell
pip install odoo12-addon-easy-my-coop-website-portal==12.0.1.0.0.99.dev9
```
Beware that for word separation, pypi uses dashes `-` and odoo underscores `_`.
