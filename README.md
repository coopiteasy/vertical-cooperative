# Vertical Cooperative

This project aims to deal with modules related to the management of cooperatives.

You'll find modules that:

* Allow people to sign up as a member of the cooperative from website
* Manage member's shares, loans and dividends
* Manage cooperative membership

Please don't hesitate to suggest one of your modules to this project.

The French and Catalan documentation can be found [here](https://doc.it4socialeconomy.org/books/application-cooperators).
This is part of the [IT 4 Social Economy](https://it4socialeconomy.org) initiative.
