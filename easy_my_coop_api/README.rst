Open Easy My Coop to the world: RESTful API.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Usage
=====

To give access to the API to a structure, go to

- Settings > Technical (debug mode) > Auth API Key
- click create and select a user, save.
- communicate the API-KEY to the structure.

It is recommended to create a technical user for the structure belonging to the group "Easy My Coop User".
For example, for the structure Coop IT Easy, create partner with

- name = coopiteasy-api-user
- Application Accesses = Cooperative Management / User
- Platform Structure = Coop IT Easy

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

The API should generate and use an external id for records instead
of odoo's generated id. It would make importing and export data as
well as migrating across versions easier.

One way would be to use uuid but the default BaseRESTController
routes would need to be rewritten: they only take integer as ids.
Another way is to define a sequence per model.
