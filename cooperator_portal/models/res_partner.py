        # "iban" key is added to the values dict. Later in `account()` (where
        # the latter method is called upstream), we read the key and write its
        # value to the partner's res.partner.bank.
        #
        # However, in between those steps, the `account()` method in upstream
        # `portal` writes the entire values dict to res.partner (where we
        # currently are!). This is bad, because "iban" is not a field of
        # res.partner.

        # So we just delete it here if it exists. It's na√Øve, and there must be
        # a better way, but the future developer who reads this comment can take
        # care of that.
        #
        # Note to future developer: `details_form_validate()` also does things
        # with an "iban" key. As far as I can tell, this is a completely
        # separate POST dictionary. This may save you some time.
